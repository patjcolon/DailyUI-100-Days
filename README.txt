001: Create a sign up page
--------------------------
I created a sign up page for virtual arcade/casino site.

- Figuring out how to make my window aligned in the center was
    a bit challenging, but I was able to make it work using containers
    and setting the minimum sizes.

- I had trouble getting the background image to work as intended.
    I had trouble getting it to apply to the background of the
    bootstrap form container, but I was eventually able to get all
    of it to work using classes and id's.

- I "wasted" a lot of time creating the background image. I know
    spending as much time as I did designing that wasn't really
    related to learning HTML/CSS, but I enjoyed it.

- I might actually create an Arcade/Casino Planet Arcadino some day!
    I have a few games and a bit of infrastructure in place for it
    in other Python projects I've created.

- I had to do a lot of research on various html/css skills in order
    to get my final product. While I know I won't remember all of
    it, I know it was great practice!
